# math1003-lectures
Due to my ADHD, I have a hard time focusing when we are just working with formulas and/or just boring equations. I find that it is a) easier to study and b) easier to comprehend when I learn about math via code. I have "transcribed" all my math lectures into code to help me try to understand and hopefully help others.
