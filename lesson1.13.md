# Lesson 1.13 - Significant Digits, Accuracy, and Precision

## What is a signficant digit?
A significant digit is a digit in a number that contributes to the accuracy of a value. This is a very vague definition, so, let's go over some of the rules of significant digits:

```
1. All non-zero digits are significant
2. Zero is a significant digit if it is between two significant digits (ex. 4040)
3. Leading 0s are not significant
4. Trailing 0s are significant only if the number contains a decimal point.
```

**accuracy**: The count of significant digits in a number.\
**precision**: The precision of a number is the place value of the rightmost significant digit.

Following those rules, what is the accuracy and precision of each of these numbers:
1. 527 - 3 digits, 1
2. 3.8 - 3 digits, 0.1
3. 3000.00 - 6 digits, 0.01

**What is the accuracy and precision of the population of Toronto?**
- 2,732,000 - the accuracy is 4 digits and the precision is 1000 (10^3).
